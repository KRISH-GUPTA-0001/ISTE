        <p>
            This project was developed for the Colloquium event to
            demonstrate fundamental web development concepts such as
            HTML structure, CSS styling, layout design, and navigation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main goal is to create a professional-looking website
            while keeping the code simple and understandable for
            first year students.
